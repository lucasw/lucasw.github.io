title: ROS Blockly

The reason that Erle forked blockly is because their custom blockly blocks are stored in it.
There ought to be a way to put these in ros_blockly, and for any I or anyone else creates in a third repo.

Make a custom js file to provide std_msgs- start with an Empty.
cp erle-spider.js and make an Empty publisher.

    Blockly.Blocks['std_msgs_empty'] = {
      init: function() {
        this.appendDummyInput()
            .appendField("Empty");
        this.setPreviousStatement(true);
        this.setNextStatement(true);
        this.setColour(260);
        this.setTooltip('Publish an Empty');
        this.setHelpUrl('http://lucasw.github.io/');
      }
    };

So is anything special needed to make blockly aware of this new file?
`frontend/blockly/generators/python/erle-spider.js` has the implementation.
It's a little ugly to write python in javascript- having individual python files loaded into js would be cleaner.


    'use strict';

    goog.provide('Blockly.Python.spider');
    goog.require('Blockly.Python');

    Blockly.Python['std_msgs_empty'] = function(block) {
      // var code = 'print "standing up..."\n';
      var code = ""
      code+="import sys\n"
      code+="import time\n"
      code+="from std_msgs.msg import Empty\n"
      code+="\n"
      code+="################\n"
      code+="## INITIALIZE ##\n"
      code+="################ \n"
      /** TODO(lucasw) Need to have the the block proved a name parameter */
      code+="pub = rospy.Publisher('/empty', Empty, queue_size=10)\n"
      code+="msg = Empty()\n"
      code+="i = 0\n"
      code+="rate = rospy.Rate(10)\n"
      code+="\n"
      code+="####################\n"
      code+="## EMPTY         ##\n"
      code+="####################\n"
      code+="while not rospy.is_shutdown() and i < 10:\n"
      code+=" pub.publish(msg)\n"
      code+=" rate.sleep()\n"
      code+=" i += 1\n"
      code+="time.sleep(2)\n"

      return code;
    };

Now try to restart front end to support this.
ctrl-c doesn't work.
backend node doesn't show up on rosnode list.
Just `ps aux | grep blockly` and then `kill -9` it.

Tried restarting it, then refreshing http://localhost/ros_blockly, but don't see anything different.
Not sure about blockly_compressed.js - do I need to regenerate that?
There are a lot of references to it in other js files.
Look at blockly/build.py
Tried running it and it mostly changed blockly_uncompressed.js.

   # The compressed file is a concatenation of all of Blockly's core files which
   # have been run through Google's Closure Compiler.  This is done using the
   # online API (which takes a few seconds and requires an Internet connection).

Don't have an internet connection currently which is why this didn't work.
