roslint error:

    Single-parameter constructors should be marked explicit.  [runtime/explicit] [5]

[securecoding.cert.org](https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=3416)

So put explicit before these constructors in header files.


This adds a space after a comment:

    s/\/\//\/\/ /

But how to correct only `//foo` to `// foo`?
This detects that case:

    /\/\/[A-z]/

So this is the combination for 'Should have a space between // and comment':

    g/ \/\/[A-z]/ s/\/\//\/\/ /

Add space before comment after semicolon:

    %s/; \/\//;  \/\//

Add space after bracket:

    %s/} \/\//}  \/\//

Move `)` to preceding line:

    %s/\n \+)/)/
