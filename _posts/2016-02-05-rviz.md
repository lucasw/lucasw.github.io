`--in-mc-wrapper` This enable a change master option, selecting crashes rviz however.


Render a textured quad in rviz, and have the texture be provided via Image topic:

How about publishing an image from rviz?
http://answers.ros.org/question/142351/publishing-virtual-camera-images-from-rviz/

https://github.com/uml-robotics/rviz_camera_stream might do it, try it out.

What is visualization_msgs/ImageMarker?

## Extract mesh_display from Vigir source code.

Fork the code, then break the connection (do not want to ever merge it back).
Lots of other interesting sounding plugins in there, should build them all and try them out later.

It needs an image topic:;

  rosrun vimjay image.py src/vimjay/data/gradient_radial2.png

And a mesh topic?
Expects a shape_msgs/Mesh, is there a node to load a dae or obj and publish it as a Mesh?

Some source code here:
http://answers.ros.org/question/147886/creating-a-collisionobject-from-a-mesh-in-hydro/

Make a python script to publish a cube mesh.

Maybe a map display could be modified to show an image rather than an OccupancyGrid.
