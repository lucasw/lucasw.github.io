Works in android chrome app (didn't work in android browser or opera, though opera may have been out of date),
doesn't seem like too much latency.

Any way to wrap the html to be able to full-screen the video?

Yes:

How to get the web video server to serve my html- do I have to fork it, or is it easier than that?
Looks like it needs to be changed to allow other html in-
maybe load a giant prefix/postfix parameter for everything that goes before and after the stream image.
