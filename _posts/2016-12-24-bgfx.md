I do have a cdefs.h in:

/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/sys/cdefs.h

sudo apt-get install g++-multilib

Give up on make linux because it tries to make 32-bit, instea make linux-release64

../../../examples/common/bgfx_utils.cpp(91): Failed to load shaders/glsl/vs_cubes.bin.
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
```

the shaders directory wasn't copied into the .build dir, so

```
cd bgfx/examples/runtime

```

07 locks up sometimes.


How to install bgfx?

Put everything in bgfx/.build/linux64_gcc/bin into a user lib location?

How to link a new project to bgfx?

Is there a way to build an example in verbose mode?

What include directory to include?
Just copy bgfx/include into a findable location?


https://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx/issues/612 shows that there is a bfgx.pc

Just going to point cmake straight at my custom build dir relative to $HOME.


## bgfx minimal example

init is failing, try debugging

build the linux64 debug target, and link to that.

How to enable BX_TRACE?

I was missing the platform data.

entry_x11.cpp in the examples/common/entry shows what is missing.

But want to use entry_sdl instead.

What about entry_noop- does anything get rendered?

How to compile the examples to use sdl?
I don't see any sdl lib in the binaries.
Need to supply --with-sdl to build process.

https://bkaradzic.github.io/bgfx/overview.html - sdl section.

SDL with ros?
Just use find_package(SDL2)
